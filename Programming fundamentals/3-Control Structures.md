## Control Structures (Loops and Conditionals)

### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow decision-making in code.

#### Example (if-else statement in Python):

```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

### Loops

Loops allow repetitive execution of code.

#### `for` loop example:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print("Iteration", i)
```

#### `while` loop example:

```python
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print("X is", x)
    x += 1
```
