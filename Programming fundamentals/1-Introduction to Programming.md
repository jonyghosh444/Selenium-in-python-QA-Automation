# Introduction to Programming

## What is Programming?

Programming is the process of writing instructions that a computer can execute to perform a specific task. These instructions, known as **code**, are written in programming languages that a computer can understand and process. Programming allows us to create software applications, automate tasks, and solve complex problems efficiently.

### Why is Programming Important?

- Automates repetitive tasks.
- Enhances problem-solving and logical thinking skills.
- Powers applications, websites, and AI systems.
- Enables data analysis and cybersecurity solutions.

## How Computers Understand Instructions

Computers only understand **binary code** (0s and 1s). Every instruction given to a computer must ultimately be converted into binary for processing.

### **Key Components**

1. **Binary Code:** The fundamental language of computers consisting of only 0s and 1s.
2. **Compilers:** Translate entire high-level code (like Python, Java, C++) into machine code at once before execution.
3. **Interpreters:** Translate and execute high-level code line by line (e.g., Python, JavaScript).

## Overview of Programming Languages

Programming languages are broadly classified into two categories:

### 1. **Low-Level Languages**

- Close to machine language (binary) and hardware-dependent.
- Example: Assembly Language, Machine Language.
- Faster execution but harder to write and debug.

### 2. **High-Level Languages**

- Closer to human language, easier to learn and write.
- Uses compilers/interpreters to convert code into machine language.
- Examples: Python, Java, C++, JavaScript.

### **Popular Programming Languages & Their Uses**

- **Python:** AI, automation, web development, data science.
- **JavaScript:** Web development, front-end, back-end.
- **C++:** System programming, game development.
- **Java:** Mobile applications (Android), enterprise applications.

## Introduction to Algorithms and Flowcharts

An **algorithm** is a step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem.

### **Example of an Algorithm:**

*Problem: Find the sum of two numbers*

1. Start
2. Input two numbers
3. Add the numbers
4. Display the sum
5. End

A **flowchart** is a visual representation of an algorithm using symbols.

**Common Flowchart Symbols:**

- **Oval:** Start/End
- **Parallelogram:** Input/Output
- **Rectangle:** Process/Action
- **Diamond:** Decision-making (yes/no)

### **Example Flowchart:**

```
 Start
   |
  Input A, B
   |
  Sum = A + B
   |
  Output Sum
   |
  End
```

## Basic Problem-Solving Approach

Programming is about problem-solving. A structured approach to problem-solving includes:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** Read and analyze the problem statement.
2. **Breaking It Down:** Divide it into smaller tasks.
3. **Designing an Algorithm:** Create a step-by-step approach.
4. **Writing Code:** Implement the solution in a programming language.
5. **Testing and Debugging:** Run and fix errors in the code.
6. **Optimizing:** Improve efficiency and readability.

### **Example Problem:**

*Design an algorithm to check if a number is even or odd.*

1. Start
2. Input a number (N)
3. If N is divisible by 2, print "Even"
4. Else, print "Odd"
5. End
